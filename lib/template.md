## Goals

1.  Quantify the impact of third party scripts on the web.
1.  Identify the third party scripts on the web that have the greatest performance cost.
1.  Give developers the information they need to make informed decisions about which third parties to include on their sites.
1.  Incentivize responsible third party script behavior.

## Methodology

[HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/) is an inititiave that tracks how the web is built. Twice a month, ~1 million sites are crawled with [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse). Lighthouse breaks down the total script execution time of each page and attributes the execution to a URL. Using [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), this project aggregates the script execution to the origin-level and assigns each origin to the responsible entity for consumption.

## Data

### How to Interpret

Each entity has a number of data points available.

1.  **Popularity (Total Number of Occurrences)** - how many scripts from their origins were included on pages
1.  **Total Impact (Total Execution Time)** - how many seconds were spent executing their scripts across the web
1.  **Average Impact (Average Execution Time)** - on average, how many milliseconds were spent executing each script
1.  **Category** - what type of script is this

### Third Parties by Category

This section breaks down third parties by category. The third parties in each category are ranked from first to last based on the average impact of their scripts. Perhaps the most important comparisons lie here. You always need to pick an analytics provider, but at least you can pick the most well-behaved analytics provider.

#### Overall Breakdown

Unsurprisingly, ads account for the largest chunk of third party script execution followed by social and analytics.

## Future Work

1.  Introduce URL-level data for more fine-grained analysis, i.e. which libraries from Cloudflare/Google CDNs are most expensive.
1.  Expand the scope, i.e. include more third parties and have greater entity/category coverage.

## FAQs

### I don't see entity X in the list. What's up with that?

This can be for one of several reasons:

1.  The entity does not have at least 100 references to their origin in the dataset.
1.  The entity's origins have not yet been identified. See [How can I contribute?](#contribute)

### The data for entity X seems wrong. How can it be corrected?

Verify that the origins in `data/entities.json` are correct. Most issues will simply be the result of mislabelling of shared origins. If everything checks out, there is likely no further action and the data is valid. If you still believe there's errors, file an issue to discuss futher.

### How can I contribute?

Only about 88% of the third party script execution has been assigned to an entity. We could use your help identifying the rest!

### Updating the Data

The query used to compute the origin-level data is in `sql/origin-execution-time-query.sql`, running this against the latest Lighthouse HTTP Archive should give you a JSON export of the latest data that can be checked in at `data/YYYY-MM-DD-origin-scripting.json`.

### Updating this README

This README is auto-generated from the template `lib/template.md` and the computed data. In order to update the charts, you'll need to make sure you have `cairo` installed locally in addition to `yarn install`.

```bash
# Install `cairo` and dependencies for node-canvas
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib
```
